# Understanding N-tier (Multi-Tier) Architecture

**N-tier architecture** splits an application into multiple sections called **tiers**, where each tier performs a specific task. These tiers can be physically separated, meaning they can run on different machines, or they can run on the same system.

---

## What Is a Tier?

A **tier** is a logical section of an application that handles one specific responsibility. For example:
- One tier might handle the user interface (what the user sees).
- Another might handle the business rules (how things work behind the scenes).
- A third might handle the database (where the data is stored).

### Key Points:
- **Tiers ≠ Layers**: While both separate responsibilities, tiers are split across technical boundaries (e.g., running on separate machines), not just functional boundaries (e.g., code structure).
- Data flows **tier by tier**: Each piece of data must pass through the tiers in order; no skipping is allowed.

## Common Example: 3-Tier Architecture

The **3-tier architecture** is the most popular type of N-tier architecture. It has three main tiers:

1. **Presentation Tier**:
   - Handles the user interface (UI) and logic for user interaction.
   - Example: A website or app screen showing product listings.

2. **Business Logic Tier**:
   - Contains the core functionality or business rules.
   - Example: Calculates discounts, processes payments, or checks inventory.

3. **Data Tier**:
   - Handles storing and retrieving data from a database.
   - Example: A database storing user accounts and purchase history.

```
+--------------------+     +--------------------+     +--------------------+
|  Presentation Tier | <-->| Business Logic Tier| <-->|      Data Tier     |
|      (UI)          |     | (Processes Rules)  |     |  (Database)        |
+--------------------+     +--------------------+     +--------------------+
```

### Example Scenario: Online Shopping

Let’s consider an online shopping website:

1. **Presentation Tier**:
   - Displays product listings, a shopping cart, and a checkout button.

2. **Business Logic Tier**:
   - Calculates the total price, applies discounts, and processes payments.

3. **Data Tier**:
   - Stores user details, product information, and order history in a database.

---

### Advantages of N-tier Architecture

1. **Independent Development**:
   - Teams can work on different tiers separately. For example, a UI team can work on the Presentation Tier while the database team focuses on the Data Tier.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Each tier can be scaled independently. For example, if the database gets too much traffic, you can upgrade or add more database servers without affecting the UI or business logic.

---

### Disadvantages of N-tier Architecture

1. **Changes Ripple Through Tiers**:
   - If you change something in one tier (e.g., adding a new database field), it can require changes in the Business Logic Tier and Presentation Tier as well.

### Is N-tier Still Relevant?

While N-tier architecture has lost popularity due to the rise of microservices, it’s still important to recognize because:
- It is simple and easy to implement for many use cases.
- It’s a foundational concept that helps understand modern architectures.
